    <h2>What is Unstable Universe?</h2>
<p>Unstable Universe is a scripted Minecraft Youtube series. There are four POVs (points of view). It is currently in its second season. Each of the POVs have their own plots but they can overlap, and in the case of the season one finale, they all come together to tell the same story.
</p>
<h2>The Main Characters</h2>
<p>The Main characters are people who upload their own POVs of Unstable Universe. <br>
There are four main characters of Unstable Universe and they are:
    <ul>
    <li> <b>ParrotX2</b><img src= https://64.media.tumblr.com/02737eed327cbb271c2b714696fb34f8/6a53be19d3fc064b-5f/s75x75_c1/905a44e70d6aa25ab6332c845ac2fa4b2b8d3af1.gifv> <br>
    Parrots POV is largely lore based. With his current season arc revolving around hunting this player called The Director who killed his best friend. There are currently (as of June 5th) 16 videos in his POV of Unstable Universe. The image I used for him is a parrot because Parrotx2 is a parrot. <a href=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soYelcGVPac&list=PLu0onnEWPanu3QkFcTyONG2uvj4RJHXaY” style="color : #77e6f7;">His POV</a>
    <li> <b> Wemmbu</b> <img src= https://64.media.tumblr.com/64deae6105ad524257737d7d1e1bd3fb/d7a49556e988c54e-ea/s75x75_c1/b1a077ad6d219dfaffbea491c82261e5d23d5dbc.gifv><br>
    Wemmbus POV is largely about PVP (player verses player combat) with his weapon of choice being the mace, having a whole story arc around getting one and training with it. There are currently (as of June 5th) 17 videos of his POV. The image I used for him is an explosion because Wemmbu likes to explode things. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@wemmbumc" style="color : #77e6f7;">His Channel</a>
    <li> <b>Spokeishere</b> <img src= https://64.media.tumblr.com/e6a2b26dfe12986269620ef5427d2152/ee3910a4b4d5ecb3-cf/s75x75_c1/70b4060c39a4cfe77cbf57ba392ec10e9e34c40b.gifv> <br>
    Spokes POV is a bit eclectic, It is hard to say just one thing that he does. So far in season 2 he has been secretly living in other peoples bases. As of June 5th there are currently 10 videos of his POV. The image I used for him is a rainbow because his Minecraft skin has rainbow design elements. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG9dbWNsems&list=PLYmAm1lW6hljKmbWACbx8jEijOW6Nwj-v" style="color : #77e6f7;">His POV</a>
    <li> <b>Flamefrags</b> <img src= https://64.media.tumblr.com/d0a0914f75e8c25f8f0f32ba7887cee8/ff13009b7c0683fc-86/s75x75_c1/1568c138159919ad5844d3c3609b47e3cc800c40.gifv> <br>
    Flamefrags is the newest main character of Unstable Universe, with him only having 3 videos of his POV as of June 5th. So far his POV has centered around PVP. The image I used for him is a fire because he has a fire theme in both his name and in his Minecraft skin. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhnn_sG7xUk&list=PLhS7X27229a_itTyKEGJ1Mj-cAwfy1ked" style="color : #77e6f7;">His POV</a> </ul>

<h2>The Side Characters</h2>
<p>Each of the Unstable Universe protagonists have a designated sidekick that follow them throughout their journeys and adventures. They do not post their own videos. <br>
The side characters are:
<ul>
    <li><b>Wifies</b> <img src= https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4d8158b883d8ddbc24ddfb51c9ecc42/85694cd026e12485-3c/s75x75_c1/b04e2290e59debc87fc471bcfec477724b3bc62e.gifv> <br>
    Wifies is Parrots sidekick. His defining traits is that he is very loyal to parrot and desperately tries to protect him, often being compared to a dog with his loyalty.
    <li><b>Eggchan</b> <img src= https://64.media.tumblr.com/54b62cb4139e549e18715840863d287c/1cd4606ec467018e-d2/s75x75_c1/4b054db80fc305611e653e626b93a3812fd83ea9.gifv> <br>
    Eggchan is Wemmbus sidekick. His defining traits is that he is not the best fighter, having more success in being a support in fights rather than actually fighting, and for most of the series sort of being Wemmbus moral compass. His image is an eye because his Minecraft skin is a giant eye wearing a suit.
    <li><b>Mapicc</b> <img src= https://64.media.tumblr.com/4d58f9a093b2b0f08f227619de0291ca/0f1dd797b5574c42-6f/s75x75_c1/9f5ed90309f9bcde37cd5084d687f7f4332c4a1c.gifv> <br>
    Mapicc is Spokes sidekick. His defining traits is being one of Spokes best friends and always helping him out. I chose the image I did for him because his Minecraft skin has a red and black theme.
    <li><b>Ashen</b> <img src= https://64.media.tumblr.com/dc6e9b74a03cee7b4709dc027703d4b5/e87bfac7f93f3cbc-af/s75x75_c1/9d18e0d20feffb7a53675a43ce91dfce3a7b890b.gifv> <br>
    Ashen is Flames sidekick. Ashen is also a tamed Minecraft wolf. Flame does not have a human sidekick yet, and maybe he won't ever have one. It is too early in his POV to tell. </ul>
